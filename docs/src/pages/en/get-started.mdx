<h2>What is Media Chrome?</h2>

Media Chrome is a collection of fully customizable media player controls and components. You can use these components to build a media player from scratch that would be difficult to achieve with an out-of-the-box player.

## Key Features

- **Web Components:** Use with or without a JavaScript framework, compatible with: React, Angular, VueJS, Svelte, and more.
- **Styling:** Use simple CSS to style components
- **Theming:** Build custom themes that group together controls and style
- **Accessible:** All controls express their state in an accessible way
- **Unified API:** Compatible with standard `<video>` and `<audio>` elements and many other media elements

## Example usage

## Install

`<media-chrome>` is packaged as an ES6 JavaScript module which is supported by all evergreen browsers and Node v12+.

### Option 1: Hosted

Load the module in the `<head>` of your HTML page. Note the `type="module"`, that's important.

<CopyToClipboard>
```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/media-chrome@0/+esm"></script>
```
</CopyToClipboard>

> Modules are always loaded asynchronously by the browser, so it's ok to load them in the head üëç

### Option 2: Bundled via npm

Install via NPM (you could also use Yarn)

<CopyToClipboard>```bash npm install media-chrome --save ```</CopyToClipboard>

Import into your app.

<CopyToClipboard>```js import 'media-chrome'; ```</CopyToClipboard>

Importing the package like this will automatically register all of the available components in the browser. This means you can add a control like `<media-play-button></media-play-button>` to your page.

## Using in your HTML

The `<media-controller>` component handles all of the communication between controls and the media being played. Wrap your media element with a `<media-controller>`, and add `slot="media"` to it.

<CopyToClipboard>
```html
<media-controller>
  <video
    slot="media"
    src="https://stream.mux.com/DS00Spx1CV902MCtPj5WknGlR102V5HFkDe/high.mp4"
  ></video>
</media-controller>
```
</CopyToClipboard>

> We're using a standard HTML `<video>` element here, but you could use any other [compatible media element](#compatible-players).

After that, each control element can be used independently.

<CopyToClipboard>
```html
<media-controller id="myController">
  <video
    slot="media"
    src="https://stream.mux.com/DS00Spx1CV902MCtPj5WknGlR102V5HFkDe/high.mp4"
  ></video>
  <media-play-button></media-play-button>
</media-controller>
````
</CopyToClipboard>

When using a control outside of a `<media-controller>` element it needs to be told which media controller it expects to be associated with. To do this you can set the `media-controller` attribute.

<CopyToClipboard>
```html
<media-play-button mediacontroller="myController"></media-play-button>
```
</CopyToClipboard>

> You could also set the mediaController property of the element with JavaScript

## Adding controls

You can add controls to your player by placing them inside of a `<media-control-bar>`. By default, this control bar will appear at the bottom of the player.

<CopyToClipboard>
```html
<media-controller>
  <video
    slot="media"
    src="https://stream.mux.com/DS00Spx1CV902MCtPj5WknGlR102V5HFkDe/high.mp4"
  ></video>
  <media-control-bar>
    <media-play-button></media-play-button>
    <media-mute-button></media-mute-button>
    <media-volume-range></media-volume-range>
    <media-time-range></media-time-range>
    <media-pip-button></media-pip-button>
    <media-fullscreen-button></media-fullscreen-button>
  </media-control-bar>
</media-controller>
```
</CopyToClipboard>

> Unlike the video element we didn't specify a "slot". This just means that the control will be placed into the default slot, which is reserved for controls.

## Compatible media elements

Media Chrome will work with any element that exposes the same API as the HTML media elements (`<video>` and `<audio>`). This means that you can replace these elements with your own if they conform to the same API. You can read more about the [HTMLMediaElement API on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement)

See the [media slot](/en/media-slot) guide to learn more about how media elements work with the media slot.
